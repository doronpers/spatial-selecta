# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded or is no longer actively maintained.

## Purpose

Following the principle of "Consolidate, Don't Delete," we preserve historical documentation for:

- Reference and context
- Tracking project evolution
- Understanding past decisions
- Historical transparency

## What's Archived

### Reports-Historical/

Contains dated implementation reports, pull request summaries, and assessments:

- **DOCKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Docker support implementation summary (January 2026)
- **PR_SUMMARY.md** - Pull request summary for Docker support (January 2026)
- **REPOSITORY_VISIBILITY_ASSESSMENT.md** - Public vs private repository assessment (January 2026)

These documents were moved from the root directory to reduce clutter while preserving historical context.

## Finding Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- [Documentation Index](../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - Complete catalog of current documentation
- [Documentation README](../README.md) - Navigation hub for all documentation

## Archival Policy

Documents are archived when:

- They are superseded by newer, consolidated versions
- They are dated reports that have been consolidated into living documents
- They contain historical context worth preserving but are no longer actively maintained

All archived content is preserved in its original form for historical reference.
